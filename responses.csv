1/13/2021 9:02:06,No,"I like it, but I'm unsure what ""chosen by your tribute"" means","I would change ""onto the ground"" to ""in the ground"" maybe to fit with dungeons specifically better? it would allow more underground stuff perhaps",4,"I really like this one, because it is very simple but has enough room for lore and things (the reason the tunnels are closed)","We must be careful that the mystery about the tunnels is good, and also that it's still fun after you find out what it is",5,I like this one,It might be odd to use medieval-to-rennaisance style weapons in this setting,4,I really like this one as well,"This one has a much more serious risk of finding out the cause of the monsters leading to the game ""ending"". Also, dropping a crystal might seem a little inconsequential but the concept is not bad, so it would just need to be ""dressed up"" in the storytelling appropriately",4,I like this plot - similar to the ancient plot but it gives the monsters more agency and makes them active and not reactive almost,We must just be careful to involve the right amount of fantasy in the archaeology otherwise some may become bored,5,Vestiges (4),Alternate Universe (2),Anticiption (5),Medieval Fantasy (1),Steampunk / Anticipation (3)
1/13/2021 13:14:05,No,It bores me. Its just a stereotypical dungeon.,It wont be fun. Not interesting.,1,Sounds interesting.,"No, although it may be tricky to expand on.",4,Sounds like a netflix adaption.,"Sounds cool, but how do you expand it?",3,Bit Vauge,"""Oops! I dropped a crystal.

1/13/2021 17:08:23,No,"It feels interesting, but the ""chosen by your tribute"" doesn't sound good, it should be voluntary",The plot feels a little contrived,3,"It sounds interesting, but there should be some mention of monsters I think",There is not much of a threat in this plot,4,Steampunk doesn't fit dungeons at all imo,The plot won't be immersive because of Minecraft's medieval theme,2,The dropping the crystal part isn't interesting to me,The plot seems a bit contrived and cliche,,"Seems interesting, but needs more details","It focuses too much on archeology, doesn't fit well with gameplay",3,Invasion (5),Medieval Fantasy (1),Alternate Universe (2),Vestiges (4),Steampunk / Anticipation (3)
1/13/2021 17:16:01,No,"While this idea is good, it's relatively common.","It's how to stay on the safe side, with things we already know.",3,"Could be really fun to do, and goes well with the actual dungeon generation.","It can quickly be boring, and the end can be lame.",3,It's the one I prefer,Some additional time will have to be spent to actually make the lore better.,5,"It's a little bit out of the usual theme, but still attaches to it.","The end will be extremely difficult to have, like MC Dungeons.",2,"Quite good actually, but will need some better description than that.","For maximal immersio, having cutscenes may be neede, and that's not really easy to do.",4,Steampunk / Anticipation (3),Invasion (5),Alternate Universe (2),Vestiges (4),Medieval Fantasy (1)

1/13/2021 17:19:52,No,"Generic, but it works","Nothing, it's classical one, but without any twist it will be boring",2,Sounds interesting,,4,"It can continue nicely, sounds good",,4,It's okay,,3,Doesn't sound like much,Might be less creative,3,Steampunk / Anticipation (3),Alternate Universe (2),Vestiges (4),Invasion (5),Medieval Fantasy (1)
1/13/2021 17:22:17,No,"Doesn't really explain the dungeons aspect of it, are you going into the portals or do the portals create the dungeons around them?",,4,"I like stories anchored in an alternate reality Earth, so this plays to my tastes well.",,5,"Another good one grounded in some sort of reality,","This one would probably require more detail put into the levels, as it's the surface and not inside a cave.",4,This is probably one of my favorite kinds of alternate universe plots.,There would probably have to be a more intricate magic system put into place.,5,"""Due to unknown reasons"" is not really enticing for me.","While it leaves a lot for interpretation, that is also a bad thing.",3,Vestiges (4),Alternate Universe (2),Medieval Fantasy (1),Steampunk / Anticipation (3),Invasion (5)
1/13/2021 17:26:12,No,Seems like it's been done before.,This plot probably wouldn't be able to extend into a lengthy story,3,"Sounds interesting, I like it.",,4,"Could be good, if done right.",,4,Don't personally like it,This plot doesn't interest me.,2,Doesn't seem very good.,This plot can quickly become boring.,1,Steampunk / Anticipation (3),Alternate Universe (2),Vestiges (4),Medieval Fantasy (1),Invasion (5)
1/13/2021 22:49:50,No,"A little generic, but sounds pretty cool.",,4,"Sounds fun but I can't help but notice the grammatical error ""how may be""","Getting lost in the tunnels could be an issue, and if the tunnels were all similar it could get boring. But if done right those things wouldn't be issues",4,"Interesting, but not quite as interesting to me.","Again, up to the execution - if not varied enough, could get pretty boring.",3,It's a cool idea.

1/13/2021 23:20:47,No,"Sounds fairly cool, like some nifty action is going down.","If one of the things you're driving for is a plot-driven minigame, then it fully depends on how you advance the story. Just about anything can be made into an engaging plot given the right twists. Obviously, there are gonna be some who just care about slaughtering monsters, but to really convey the effect for those interested in the lore, there's gonna be an end goal worth getting to both plot-wise and gameplay-wise. I'd imagine that goes without saying, though. ",3,This one strikes me as a bit more interesting. A little less on the generic side tbh.,"One thing I think would go hand-in hand with this sort of plot would be a sense of ""digging up the truth as you go deeper."" Maybe the deeper/farther in you go, the more bizarre and unexplainable the terrain and enemies get. ",4,Fallout but in the sky! This does sound intriguing as well.,"One of the issues I personally have with the Fallout games as well as most post-nuclear apocalypse is the very plain and colorless terrain. It's fine if at first that's what it seems like, but perhaps you eventually stumble across some sort of mutated roofed forest or something? That would be pretty hype.",5,"Oh boy, ancient unknown artifacts. Hope one of those 'hidden powers' is like, a lighthouse that fires huge lasers of destruction upon unsuspecting enemies. Just kidding. ","Honestly, it's pretty solid, plenty of room to explore different options. I personally liked the post-nuclear one a bit more, but for the sake of the plot itself, this one is probably more solid.",5,Animated skeletal T-rexes?? Probably almost definitely too much for a minigame server.,"It's pretty unique, that's for sure. I'm assuming that the ultimate goal of this one would be to figure out the origins or of these mysterious monsters and ways to eradicate them? Not too sure on this one, but maybe one thing that would be cool to do would be to have two vastly different outcomes. Maybe the first could be dependent on a sort of stealth tactic of staying undetected while going to the furthest lengths to learn about these entities, while the other is a straight brute force one where at one point it becomes obvious that this force you're going up against is bigger than what it originally seemed, and you have one final stand against them in order to escape alive. That's just rambling, though, as that too would probably be too much for a minigame.",3,Steampunk / Anticipation (3),Vestiges (4),Alternate Universe (2),Invasion (5),Steampunk / Anticipation (3)
